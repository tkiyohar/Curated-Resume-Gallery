## ⭐⭐ Capstone: Custom Pencil Printer(Fusion 360) ⭐⭐
- Created in three months over Summer 2022 using Fusion 360
- Separately includes a complete wiring schematic for electronic parts
- Follows incremental completion plan and cost/sourcing sheet for materials (also included)


## 3D Printed Chu Repeating Crossbow (Inventor)
- Created using Autodesk Inventor
- Modeled after historical measurements and mechanisms used in the ancient Chu repeating crossbows
- Incorporates PVC pipe for use in crossbow limbs (machined separately)
- Due to a data loss, I no longer have to the original CAD file (I have included the g-code I used to print it though) 


## Cookie Cutters (OnShape)
- Created in Onshape by incorporating custom DXF files produced using InkScape and Gimp
- Includes a cookie-cutter promoting a local non-profit "Santa Monica pickleball club" (https://santamonicapickleballclub.org/) as well as two cookie cutters of my sister's cats (Jiji and Kuro)
- All designs went through iterative testing/prototyping before their final versions
 
 
## 3D Printed Walker Leg (FreeCAD)
- Created using FreeCAD
- Dimensions of leg determined from torque and friction calculation
- Inspired by Boston Dynamics robot dog videos
- Due to a data loss, I only have photos of the finished project
