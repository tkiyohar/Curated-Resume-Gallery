# Custom Pencil Printer (Fusion 360)
I started this project in 2022 and will hopefully complete it this summer, pending my work schedule. The project is my spin on a pen plotter that uses mechanical pencil lead instead of ink to draw in a gradient of color shades dependent on the amount of pressure it applies. I intend to adapt an existing program like those used with x-carves to translate a depth map into pressure and pathing instructions and to use a program like Inkscape to derive a depth map from a provided image. These programs will be tied together using their corresponding APIs into a custom tool I will write for my project. At this time, I have the V1 3D model completed in SolidWorks (Planning on redesigning extruder), the V1 circuitry design (Planning on redoing torque control so it's less janky), a complete parts list, and a project plan.
