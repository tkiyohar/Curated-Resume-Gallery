# Resume-Robotics-Systems-Examples
Examples of Previous Robotics Systems that I lead the design and construction of demonstrating design and manufacturing abilities

(^For all the robots above, I led the construction of at least one of their primary subsystems)

### READER'S NOTE: 
**Over my 8-years participating in FRC, I worked on many more robots and created more robotic sub systems than just the ones listed below and pictured above. However, due to a schoolwide Google account wipe, I no longer have access to the media/files documenting them. If you have any questions or would like to know more about my robotics portfolio, please contact me at trentkiyohara@gmail.com**

<b>Other subsystems that I lead the design and creation of:</b>
1. Automated Ball Intake and Magazine                                   2. Modular Superstructure for Subsystem and Bumper Mounting
3. Collapsable, Pulley-Driven Vertical Actuator               4. Grappling Hook Deployer and Climber   
5. Rapid Testing Table for Single and Dual Flywheel Accelerators

## ⭐⭐ Capstone: Ring Actuator ⭐⭐
- Produced following iterative prototyping and design refinements
- Designed with mechanical failure points to prevent damage to the primary mechanism during collisions
- Utilizes custom, onboard vision-targeting software to load and place rings on targets
- Powered using pressurized air tanks/pneumatics and controlled via solenoid valves
- Created using a variety of manufacturing techniques ranging from automated CNC machining  to hand tools
 
## Winch Climber
- First subsystem I ever led the creation of (designed in 8th grade)
- Extremly reliable system (success rate higher than 90%)
- Built using several common and uncommon manufacturing tools (drill press, sewing owl, etc.)
