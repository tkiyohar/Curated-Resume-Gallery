# Resume-Robotics-Systems-Examples
Examples of Previous Robotics Systems that I lead the design and construction of demonstrating design and manufacturing abilities
 

## Ring Actuator
- powered using pressurized air tanks and controled using solinoid valves
- created using multiple manufacturing techniques including an automated CNC machine
- extremely reliable both in testing and on the field
- built with failure points in mind to insure that, on colision, the mechanism itself would remain unharmed


## Hook Deployment Arm And Winch
- created with a lifting capacity of multiple hundreds of pounds
- developed under intense time presure and limited resources
- utilizes only one motor for its entire motion and was built and tested in less than 4 weeks
- designed to take minimal space and to fit "around" all other systems that had already been incorperated on the robot
 
 
## Velcro Climbing Winch With Custom Rope
- first subsystem I ever led the creation of
- build and designed in 8th grade
- unanamously recognized as the most reliable system on the robot that year
- built using several common manufacturing tools (e.g. drill presses, circular saws, etc.), as well as several uncommon ones (such as a sewing awl and other fabric tools)
