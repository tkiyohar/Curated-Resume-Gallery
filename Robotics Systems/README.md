# Resume-Robotics-Systems-Examples
Examples of Previous Robotics Systems that I lead the design and construction of demonstrating design and manufacturing abilities

### READER'S NOTE: 
**Over my career as a roboticist, I've designed and created many more robotics systems than just the ones listed below. However, due to a schoolwide Google account wipe, I no longer have access to the media documenting them. If you have any questions or would like to know more about my robotics portfolio, please contact me at trentkiyohara@gmail.com**

                                      Some other systems that I lead the design of:
1. ball intake and magazine                                   2. modular superstructure for subsystem and bumper mounting
3. collapsable, pulley-driven vertical actuator               4. grappling hook deployer and climber   
                                 5. commutable rapid testing table for flywheel designs

## Ring Actuator (best documented)
- produced following iterative prototyping and design refinements
- designed with mechanical failure points to prevent damage to the mechanism during significant collisions
- utilizes custom, onboard vision-targeting software to load and place rings on targets
- powered using pressurized air tanks/pneumatics and controlled via solenoid valves
- created using a variety of manufacturing techniques ranging from automated CNC to hand tools
- extremely reliable both in testing and on the field
 
 
## Winch Climber
- first subsystem I ever led the creation of
- build and designed in 8th grade
- unanimously recognized as the most reliable system on the robot that year
- built using several common manufacturing tools (e.g. drill presses, circular saws, etc.), as well as several uncommon ones (such as a sewing awl and other fabric tools)
