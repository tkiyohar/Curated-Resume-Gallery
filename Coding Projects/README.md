## ⭐⭐ Capstone: UCSDCoursesScraper ⭐⭐
- Most recent and most ambitious Python project to date
- Incorporates Python's “Selenium” package to access the UCSD course enrollment tool to retrieve a student's course info
- Uses the "googleapiclient" package to create a custom color-coordinated calendar with descriptive events corresponding to a student's course info
- Utilizes several common Python packages like “re” (regular expression) and “pickle” (serialization package) for data manipulation as well as “sys” and “pprint” for cleaner debugging.
- Automates a task that generally requires multiple hours of repetitive busywork down to a few minutes.
 
 
## LAB_HOURS
- Created to track the number of hours members of my robotics team spent in the school robotics room. 
- Built using the “Gspread” and "oauth2client" Python packages to read and edit Google sheets.
- Includes a custom package installer making it easy to configure and run on new devices.
- Program saw usage and success for about half of the robotics season before hitting the free limit on Google API calls.
 
 
## Sorba 2.0
- First program I ever wrote to automate a repetitive task.
- Built using the “pyautogui” Python package
- Written to take any on-screen Spanish words, translate them, and create flashcards of them in an online tool called Quizlet
- Automates the task of flashcard creation (~45 seconds) down to as little as 3 seconds (this would save multiple hours over the creation of hundreds of flashcards)
