# Welcome to Trent Kiyohara's Resume Projects Gallery
![Overview Collage](https://github.com/tkiyohar/Resume-Gallery-Assets/blob/main/Overview_Collage.png)
- In each of the included folders, you will find past projects that I have done that illustrate my abilities in **Coding, 3D Design/CAD, and Robotics**.

- All projects included in this gallery are **Passion Projects** (i.e., I took the initiative to start them, design them, and completed them during my free time)

- In addition to other projects, each of the folders also includes a **⭐⭐ Capstone Project ⭐⭐** that I believe best showcases my abilities in the selected category.
 I highly recommend looking at Capstone Project first since they are the best documented and contain some of my most recent and impressive works.
 
- Please message me at **trentkiyohara@gmail.com** if you have any questions about my projects or resume.
